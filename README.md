## About the design
:white_square_button: This Mandala Art composes different colored squares that are perfectly symmetrical to form a circle, creating another distinction of designs to form a beautiful mandala. I came up with this design because its etymology defines it as a "magic circle" confined within a square and divided into pieces centered on a single central point.
